# card color selector

Here we are using react-router and react-router-dom library for navigation.

We have one route which is defined as Home '/' which renders the <code>Home</code> component

MOdify the code inside applyColor function of <Home> component such that when we click on color buttons than the card color also changes to that particular color

You also need to modify <ColorSelector> component accordingly
